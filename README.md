# Introduction

This project was created to help me on my bartending weekly tasks.
As a weekly routine on my hospitality job, I have to batch several liters of cocktails to be sold through the week.
Every week the amounts will depend on how much we have left from previous week.

This tool just calculates the amount have to do based on two options.

1 - The Total amount I want to batch
2 - The Total amount available of one of the ingredients
